Use an interest-free cash advance app. Mobile apps like Earnin, Dave and Brigit can offer interest-free or low-fee advances on your paycheck, though there are eligibility requirements and caps on how much you can borrow.

Get a personal loan from a credit union or online lender. A personal loan will likely carry a lower APR than a payday loan, so it’s more affordable. Credit unions tend to offer the lowest rates for bad-credit applicants, and many offer payday alternative loans, specifically, but you’ll need to become a member before applying. Online lenders also serve bad-credit borrowers and can fund loans the next business day, but rates may be higher.

Ask if your bank offers a small-dollar loan. Traditional banks are beginning to offer small-dollar loans that can cover emergency expenses. U.S. Bank’s Simple Loan, Bank of America’s Balance Assist Loan and Wells Fargo’s Flex Loan all provide short-term funds for existing customers in good standing.
