Payday and other high-cost lenders prefer to explain the cost of borrowing in terms of fees rather than interest. However, payday lenders, like all lenders, must disclose the annual percentage rate the fee equates to before the borrower signs a loan agreement. A $100 payday loan with a $15 fee due in two weeks equates to an APR of 391%.

The APR is the best apples-to-apples cost comparison tool for loans and credit cards. For example, if a credit card has a 15% APR, a personal loan has a 25% APR and a payday loan has a 350% APR, then the credit card is the least expensive option and the payday loan is the most expensive.
