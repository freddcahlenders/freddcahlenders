Paying back a payday loan doesn't usually build credit. Most payday lenders don’t report on-time payments to credit bureaus, so the loan can't help your credit score.

If you don’t pay the loan back, however, your credit can be damaged. The payday lender may report the default to the credit bureaus or sell the debt to a collections agency that will do so, which will hurt your score.
Are payday loans legal?

Each state has its own payday loan regulations, usually by setting limits on the APR lenders can charge on a small loan, based on the loan’s size and repayment term
. Many states have enacted tight restrictions on the cost of consumer loans in the past few years, effectively outlawing payday loans, but they’re not illegal everywhere.
